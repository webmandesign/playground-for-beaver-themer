## Description

This theme relies solely on using Beaver Themer (and Beaver Builder) plugin to create a whole website. The theme itself does not display any WordPress website content.

It only takes a few moments to create all the theme layouts and views using Beaver Themer and modify it in an easy-to-use drag and drop interface. This simply allows you to create and style any website section to your needs. No coding required.

Actually, the only coding you might need to do, is apply some additional CSS styles based on your needs. Such as typography or forms styles. For information on what basic styles the theme provides, please refer to FAQ section below.

You can obtain Beaver Themer plugin from https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/
You will also need the Beaver Builder plugin, but only the paid version, as the free version is not compatible with Beaver Themer. Get Beaver Builder from https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/pricing/
