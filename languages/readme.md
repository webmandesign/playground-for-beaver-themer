# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.


## Translating the theme

### Using [**Poedit**](http://www.poedit.net/)

1. Make a copy of the original `katsuko.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the copied file now: add hyphen followed with [your language code locale](https://translate.wordpress.org/), and change file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named `katsuko-en_GB.po`, for example.
3. Use [Poedit](https://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation in `mo` file format.
4. Upload translated `katsuko-en_GB.mo` and `katsuko-en_GB.po` file into your WordPress languages directory, into `themes` folder (such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/katsuko-en_GB.mo` - if the `themes` folder does not exist in your WordPress languages directory, create it).

### Using [**Loco Translate**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin

If you would like translate the theme directly in your WordPress dashboard you need to use a specialized plugin for that.

Install and activate [**Loco Translate**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin. For instructions on how to use the plugin please refer to [beginner's guide](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/beginners) and/or [technical overview](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/overview).


## Contributing your translations

Please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/webmandesign/playground-for-beaver-themer/issues) and attach your translation files so they can be bundled with the theme in the future update.
