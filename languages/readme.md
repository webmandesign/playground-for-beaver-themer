# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.


## Translating the theme

### Using [**Poedit**](http://www.poedit.net/)

1. Make a copy of the original `playground-for-beaver-themer.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the copied file now. The naming convention is based on [your language code locale](https://translate.wordpress.org/) and renaming the file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named as `en_GB.po`, for example.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation also in `mo` translation file format.
4. Upload translated `en_GB.mo` file into your WordPress language directory, such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/playground-for-beaver-themer/en_GB.mo`.

### Using [**Loco Translate**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin

If you would like translate the theme directly in your WordPress dashboard you need to use a specialized plugin for that. Please install and activate [**Loco Translate**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin. For instructions on how to use the plugin please refer to [beginner's guide](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/beginners) and/or [technical overview](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/overview).
