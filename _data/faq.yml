- q: Do I really need to use Beaver Themer plugin?
  a: "Yes. The theme is basically useless without the Beaver Themer (and Beaver Builder) plugin. It was built specifically for use with these plugins. You can purchase both at [WPBeaverBuilder.com](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/?fla=67)."

- q: How to use Beaver Themer plugin?
  a: "Please check the official [plugin knowledge base](https://kb.wpbeaverbuilder.com/collection/397-beaver-themer). Also, folks at WPBeginner released a comprehensive [tutorial article on how to use Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-easily-create-a-custom-wordpress-theme/) plugin."

- q: How can I update the theme?
  a: "You can [download](#download) the newest version of the theme at this very page and overwrite the copy on your server via FTP then.


Or, for automatic theme updates, you can install [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin which will take care of the theme updates for you."

- q: What styles does the theme contain?
  a: "Stylesheets are compiled from SASS partial files from within `assets/sass` folder. The theme enqueues 3 stylesheets:


1. `assets/css/normalize.css` - Makes browsers [render all elements more consistently](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and in line with modern standards.<br>

2. `assets/css/base.css` - The RTL (Right To Left) languages ready stylesheet containing basic styles for:

  - border box sizing on all elements,

  - inheriting border color from parent elements,

  - basic typography styles, line height, default font families, and heading sizes,

  - vertical spacing for most block elements,

  - headings, blockquote, preformatted text and table elements,

  - form elements and buttons,

  - required `.screen-reader-text` accessibility class,

  - default WordPress alignments (please note that optional `.alignwide` and `.alignfull` classes are not styled),

  - image captions,

  - comments,

  - gallery,

  - images and other embed media,

  - logo,

  - pagination,

  - widgets.
  <br>

3. If a child theme is used, it also enqueues child theme's `style.css` file."

- q: What styles are NOT contained in the theme?
  a: "Basically, all styles mentioned in previous answer are very basic. In most cases they are sufficient enough, but in certain cases you might need to style your website elements to your needs using additional CSS code. For example, you could wish to style comments to your needs, or form elements, or link colors and behavior, or global website typography.


Please feel free to put your custom CSS code into **Appearance &rarr; Customize &rarr; Additional CSS**, or into your child theme's `style.css` file."

- q: How can I set up custom fonts?
  a: "If you would like to set up custom fonts for your website, such as Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts, the simplest solution is to [use a dedicated plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/fonts/).


Other than that you could use your child theme to load your custom font files into your website and use a custom CSS code to apply it on your website elements."

- q: How to use navigational menus?
  a: "The theme allows you to [create any number of menus](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide). However, it does not display any of them on front-end of your website. Please use Beaver Builder's [Menu module](https://kb.wpbeaverbuilder.com/article/65-menu-module-overview) to display your menus wherever needed."

- q: How to use sidebars (widgetized areas)?
  a: "Theme registers a single [widgetized area called 'Sidebar'](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets). However, this sidebar is not displayed on the front-end of your website by the theme. Please use Beaver Builder's [Sidebar module](https://kb.wpbeaverbuilder.com/article/71-sidebar-module-overview) to display it wherever needed.


Surely, you can use a [sidebar management plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/sidebars/) to create other widgetized areas if needed."

- q: How can I set <code>$content_width</code> global theme variable?
  a: "You can do this directly in theme options at **Appearance &rarr; Customize &rarr; Theme Options &rarr; Layout &rarr; Content width**.


Or you can define the `PFBT_CONTENT_WIDTH` PHP constant in your child theme's `functions.php` file."

- q: How to translate the theme to your language?
  a: "The theme is fully localization ready. If it is not yet localized, translated into your language, you can translate its texts yourself according the instructions in [`languages/readme.md` file](https://github.com/webmandesign/playground-for-beaver-themer/blob/master/languages/readme.md)."

- q: What hooks are available in the theme?
  a: "The theme contains several helpful action and filter hooks you can use to hook your child theme functionality to or modify the theme variables. Relevant action hooks are also available for use in Beaver Themer parts.


Available hooks:


- `pfbt_html_before` - action hook in `header.php` file,
